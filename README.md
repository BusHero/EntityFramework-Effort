## Overview

Effort is a powerful tool that enables a convenient way to create automated tests for Entity Framework based applications. 

It is basically an ADO.NET provider that executes all the data operations on a lightweight in-process main memory database instead of a traditional external database. It also provides some intuitive helper methods that make this provider really easy to use with existing ObjectContext or DbContext classes. A simple addition to existing code might be enough to create data driven tests that can run without the presence of the external database.

You want to help us? 
Your donation directly helps us maintaining and growing ZZZ Free Projects. We canâ€™t thank you enough for your support.

### Why should I contribute to this free & open source library?
We all love free and open source libraries!
But there is a catch! Nothing is free in this world.
Contributions allow us to spend more of our time on: Bug Fix, Content Writing, Development and Support.

We NEED your help. Last year alone, we spent over **3000 hours** maintaining all our open source libraries.

### How much should I contribute?
Any amount is much appreciated. All our libraries together have more than 100 million downloads, if everyone could contribute a tiny amount, it would help us to make the .NET community a better place to code!

Another great free way to contribute is  **spreading the word** about the library!
 
A **HUGE THANKS** for your help.
